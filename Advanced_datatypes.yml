  - marks

Name: Suyog Gampawar

# pairs: keys may have duplicate values
# !!pairs


pair example: !!pairs
  - job: student
  - job: teacher
# This will be an array of hashtables

# Same as
pair example: !!pairs [ job: student, job: teacher]

# !!set will allow you to have unique values
names: !!set
  ? Suyog
  ? Saurabh
  ? Sushil
# '?' this means you cannot have more than one string or in this case more than one name

# Now if you want an entire sequence as a value then
# Use dictionary -> !!omap
students: !!omap
 - Suyog: 
   - name: Suyog Gampawar
   - Weight: '72kg'

# Reusing some properties with the help of anchors
likings: &likes
 fav fruit: Mangoes
 dislikes: grapes

# So if this above info is repetitive in many of the sequences that you're gonna write then just anchor it and rather copy pasting it judt do this: 
person1: 
 Name: Suyog Gampawar
 <<: *likes
# Now that likings info will be copied as it is
# Now ik this looks familiar So yeah this works similar to a pointer where we use both '&' and '*'

# You can override some value too like: 
person2: 
 Name: Suyog Gampawar
 <<: *likes
 dislikes: berries
# So now the value in og dislikes will be overriden by the latest given value of 'berries'
